    <h1>Dedication</h1>
  
    <p class="indent">I dedicate this work to my newly found friend Ced Eunijoy and I wanted to thank you for inspiring me to write this book. I am very surprised of your talent not only in computers but in all. I never imagined that I will know someone like you. I fell in love with you instantly although you never notice that and you only treat me as a friend, I really value that friendship. Thank you for letting me be a part of your life.</p>
