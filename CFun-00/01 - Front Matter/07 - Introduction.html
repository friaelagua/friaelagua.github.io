    <h1>Introduction</h1>
  
    <p class="indent">I write this book for others to see how fun and adventurous programming is.</p>
    
    <p class="indent">This book is for beginners and intermediate level programmers. You must have some basic computer programming knowledge and must know how to encode and run basic programs like Hello World to use this book and I'm not using IDEs but only command line scripts and a text editor. I use nano text editor but you can choose any text editor you want. You also need a C compiler. I'm using GNU C Compiler. I code in my tablet using Termux Linux. if you don't know Linux you must try it. Linux is a free and open source software (FOSS) it has many distros you choose what is working for you.</p>
    
    <p class="indent">So let us begin.</p>
